# Safe Multisig Vault Playground

This is just a simple project to play around with multisig vaults and the <a href="https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-aa-sdk/safe-core-sdk">SAFE{CORE} AA SDK</a> and <a href="https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-protocol/safe-core-protocol">SAFE{CORE} PROTOCOL</a>

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
